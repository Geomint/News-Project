<h2>BBC News - Project</h2>

<h3>Planning:</h3>
<p>I decided to use Balsamiq mockups 3 to plan out a rough draft for the project. This would help me get an idea of 
<br> layout and also allow me to see how the content would be displayed on the page. 
Here is a link to the original mockup: https://imgur.com/a/imyomTA <br> I made sure to document a list of functions i wanted the site to be able to do so that the scope was clear. 
<br>  </p>


<h3>Difficulties:</h3>
<p>This is the first time i've worked with AJAX so understanding the fundamentals was a challenge for me. After making sense of the Jquery syntax i found it much easier to 
manipulate the code in order to pull the information correctly from the RSS feed. <br> <br> During writing the code that would request the XML document from the BBC, i ran into 
a CORS error which i had not seen before. I took to the internet to find out a solution for the issue, 
i managed find a way using a PHP script that would run the request on the client side, thus bypassing the CORS block. This was the first time ive used PHP and therefore took me a 
while longer to implement.

Unfortunatley at the time of writing this document the Thumbnails are not 
populating on the application, this is a function I have yet to use in my coding education.
</p>

<h3>Future Implementations?</h3>
<p>In the future i would like to implement additional content to either side of the app to improve user experience, for example
adding a search function. Also adding some pagination to control how many stories are loaded per page.

I would also like to implement Gulp.js and its functions once i get more practice with this code.</p>

<h3>Overall:</h3>
<p>Overall i have enjoyed attempting this project and have learned alot from doing so.</p>
